Router Web Monitor</h1>
<p>The built-in web monitor (configured in the tnwgd XML configuration file; see <a class="el" href="xmlconfigurationreference.html">XML Configuration Reference</a>) provides valuable statistics about the UM Router and its portals, for which, the Web Monitor separates into receive statistics and send statistics. The Web Monitor provides a page for each endpoint and peer portal.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="mainpage"></a>
Main Page</h2>
<p>This page displays general information about the UM Router, and also provides the following links to more detailed statistical and configuration information.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt><b>UM</b> <b>Router</b> <b>Configuration</b> </dt><dd>Displays the UM Router XML configuration file used by this UM Router.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt><b>Portals</b> </dt><dd>Displays portal statistics and information, one portal per page. The Portals page allows you to link to any of the Peer or Endpoint portals configured for the UM Router.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt><b>Topology</b> <b>Info</b> </dt><dd>This links to a page that displays UM Router network connectivity information from the perspective of this UM Router.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt><b>Path</b> <b>Info</b> </dt><dd>This lets you query and display a hop path that messages will take between any two TRDs.</dd></dl>
<p>On some platforms, the Main page may include a link (GNU malloc info) to a memory allocation display page that displays the following:</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt><b>arena</b> </dt><dd>Non-mmapped space allocated (bytes)</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt><b>ordblks</b> </dt><dd>Number of free chunks</dd></dl>

<p><br />
 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="endpointportalpage"></a>
Endpoint Portal Page</h2>
<p>The Endpoint Portal Page displays Receive and Send statistics for the selected endpoint portal. Receive statistics pertain to messages entering the portal from its connected TRD. Send statistics pertain to messages sent out to the TRD.</p>
<p>Click on any of the links at the top of the page to review configuration option values for the portal's UM topic resolution domain. The two columns provide different units of measure for a given statistic type, where the first column is typically in fragments or messages (depending on the statistic type), and the second column is in bytes.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="umrouterlogmessages"></a>
UM Router Log Messages</h1>
<p>The UM Router daemon generates log messages that are used to monitor its health and operation. You can configure these to be directed to "console" (standard output), "syslog", or a specified log "file", via the <a class="el" href="xmlconfigurationreference.html#drocfg_log">&lt;log&gt;</a> configuration element. Normally "console" is only used during testing, as a persistent log file is preferred for production use. The UM Router does not over-write log files on startup, but instead appends them.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="umrouterrollinglogs"></a>
UM Router Rolling Logs</h2>
<p>To prevent unbounded disk file growth, the UM Router supports rolling log files. When the log file rolls, the file is renamed according to the model: <br />
&#160;&#160;<em>CONFIGUREDNAME</em><code>_</code><em>PID</em><code>.</code><em>DATE</em><code>.</code><em>SEQNUM</em> <br />
where: </p><ul>
<li>
<em>CONFIGUREDNAME</em> - Root name of log file, as configured by user. </li>
<li>
<em>PID</em> - Process ID of the UM Router daemon process. </li>
<li>
<em>DATE</em> - Date that the log file was rolled, in YYYY-MM-DD format. </li>
<li>
<em>SEQNUM</em> - Sequence number, starting at 1 when the process starts, and incrementing each time the log file rolls. </li>
</ul>
<p>For example: <code>umrouterlog_9867.2017-08-20.2</code></p>
<p>The user can configure when the log file is eligible to roll over by either or both of two criteria: size and frequency. The size criterion is in millions of bytes. The frequency criterion can be daily or hourly. Once one or both criteria are met, the next message written to the log will trigger a roll operation. These criteria are supplied as attributes to the <a class="el" href="xmlconfigurationreference.html#drocfg_log">&lt;log&gt;</a> configuration element.</p>
<p>If both criteria are supplied, then the first one to be reached will trigger a roll. For example, consider the setting: </p><pre class="fragment">  &lt;log type="file" size="23" frequency="daily"&gt;store.log&lt;/log&gt;
</pre><p> Let say that the log file grows at 1 million bytes per hour. At 11:00 pm, the log file will reach 23 million bytes, and will roll. Then, at 12:00 midnight, the log file will roll again, even though it is only 1 million bytes in size.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The rolling logs cannot be configured to automatically overwrite old logs. Thus, the amount of disk space consumed by log files will grow without bound. The user must implement a desired process of archiving or deleting older log files according to the user's preference.</dd></dl>

<p><b>Connection Failure Messages</b></p>
<pre class="fragment">peer portal [name] failed to connect to peer at [IP:port] via [interface] [err]: reason

</pre><p><b>Endpoint Messages</b></p>
<p>If a UMP store is adjacent to the UM Router, and the UM Router has been restarted, you typically see messages of the form:</p>
<pre class="fragment">endpoint portal [name] has no forwarding entry for destination ctxinst [string], dropping msg (lbmc cntl ume)
</pre><p>These messages are normal, and cease when the UM Router has established the forwarding information for the given context.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="umroutertransportstats"></a>
UM Router Transport Stats</h1>
<p>Using the <code>&lt;monitor&gt;</code> element in a UM Router's XML configuration file and the UMS Monitoring feature, you can monitor the transport activity between the UM Router and its Topic Resolution Domain. The configuration also provides Context and Event Queue statistics. The statistics output identifies individual portals by name. </p>
