 * LBM passes received messages to the application by means of a callback.
 * I.e. the LBM context thread reads the network socket, performs its
 * higher-level protocol functions, and then calls an application-level
 * function that was set up during initialization.  This callback function
 * has some severe limitations placed upon it.  It must execute very quickly;
 * any potentially blocking calls it might make will interfere with the proper
 * execution of the LBM context thread.  One common desire is for the receive
 * function to send an LBM message (via lbm_src_send), however this has the
 * potential to produce a deadlock condition.  If it is desired for the
 * receive callback function to call LBM or other potentially blocking
 * functions, it is strongly advised to make use of an event queue, which
 * causes the callback to be executed from an application thread.  See the
 * example tool lbmrcvq.c for an example of using a receiver event queue.
