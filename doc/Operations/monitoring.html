<h1><a class="anchor" id="monitoringintroduction"></a>
Monitoring Introduction&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#monitoringintroduction">&lt;-</a></small></h1>
<p>Monitoring lets you: </p><ul>
<li>
Evaluate the health of the messaging system. </li>
<li>
Identify inefficiencies that can cause latency and limit capacity. </li>
<li>
Track utilization trends and prevent future overload. </li>
<li>
Provide forensic data to help diagnose system trouble. </li>
</ul>
<p>UM deployments are typically large-scale, loosely-coupled systems, used by many diverse end-user groups who may have little knowledge of each others usage patterns or future plans. Especially when there are resources shared by these groups, it is important to monitor UM's operation and performance characteristics. This can help you avoid problems, and when problems do arise, having monitoring data can be critical to diagnosing the root causes.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="networkandhostmonitoring"></a>
Network and Host Monitoring&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#networkandhostmonitoring">&lt;-</a></small></h2>
<p>An effective monitoring strategy should include monitoring of the host and network resources that UM depends on. Informatica requests that you monitor and record data from the following sources: </p><ul>
<li>
Network equipment (switches, routers, firewalls). Includes packet drops at ports and trunks. Often also includes always-running packet capture (for example, <a href="https://www.pico.net/corvil-analytics">Corvil</a>). </li>
<li>
Hosts. Includes CPU load, memory usage, hardware errors, and packet drops (kernel and user sockets). Where possible, monitor resource usage per-process. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are many vendors of monitoring technology that do a good job of recording and visualizing network and host statistics and logged events. Your operations staff should have fast and easy access to this monitoring data. Ideally, your monitoring tools will raise alerts when problems are detected.</p>
<p>Detailed discussion of host and network monitoring is beyond the scope of the Ultra Messaging documentation.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ummonitoring"></a>
UM Monitoring&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#ummonitoring">&lt;-</a></small></h2>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are three kinds of UM monitoring data that should be monitored and recorded: </p><ul>
<li>
UM events. This can be from either user applications or UM daemons (Store, DRO, etc). Events are typically logged and saved to local log files. </li>
<li>
UM Library Statistical data. This can be from user applications or from UM daemons, and mostly contains information about data UM transports. </li>
<li>
UM Daemon Statistical data. This is daemon-specific data (Store, DRO, etc). </li>
</ul>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="monitoringumapplications"></a>
Monitoring UM Applications&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#monitoringumapplications">&lt;-</a></small></h1>
<p>These are application programs that you, the UM user, have developed. As you write your code, Informatica requests that all applications do the following: </p><ol>
<li>
Record all failed API calls with informational string, typically to a log file. </li>
<li>
Record all non-message events delivered to the application, typically to a log file, </li>
<li>
Record all asynchronous UM log messages (strings), typically to a log file. </li>
<li>
Record UM library statistics, typically using UM automatic monitoring. </li>
</ol>
<p>Items 1-3 typically involve writing to log file on the local host. See <a class="el" href="monitoring.html#applicationlogfile">Application Log File</a>.</p>
<p>Item 4 typically involves configuring the UM library to publish its statistics to a <a class="el" href="monitoring.html#centralizedcollector">Centralized Collector</a>. The statistics are sampled and published using UM's <a class="el" href="monitoring.html#automaticmonitoring">Automatic Monitoring</a> feature. (There are alternatives; see <a class="el" href="legacymonitoring.html">Legacy Monitoring</a>.)</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="applicationlogfile"></a>
Application Log File&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#applicationlogfile">&lt;-</a></small></h2>
<p>During the design and development of user applications, Informatica requests that users implement the following logging items:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="startli">The UM library delivers events to the application. Informatica requests that applications log all informational and exceptional events. Logs are classified as to their severity, which is useful for automatic log file scanners to detect potential problems and raise alerts.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Informatica requests that logs be written with a time stamp with at least second resolution, the log severity level, and the descriptive text of the event being logged.</b> </li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that different threads might need to write logs asynchronously to each other. Your logger code must be thread-safe.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">Some of UM events represent the delivery of user data messages. These events do not need to be logged. Other events are informational and are delivered during normal operation, like Beginning of Session (BOS). These should be logged because they can be essential to diagnose problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Informatica requests that all informational (non-message) events be logged.</b> </li>
</ul>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">Many UM event callbacks can deliver a variety of different event types. For example, a receiver callback can be delivered user data messages, Beginning of Session (BOS) events, etc. The application code typically recognizes those events that it is written to recognize, and ignores the others.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Informatica requests that unrecognized events be logged with their event types.</b> </li>
</ul>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">The UM library can sometimes detect internal conditions that are not associated with deliverable events or API calls. These are delivered to the application with the "logger callback" (<a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.14_RC6/doc/Operations/api.tag:../API/" href="../API/lbm_8h.html#aae14099b91f2919f424e81f20ca10951">lbm_log()</a> for C, <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.14_RC6/doc/Operations/javaapi.tag:../JavaAPI/" href="../JavaAPI/classcom_1_1latencybusters_1_1lbm_1_1LBM.html#ac0bd24d34cdd5039586c8f576c015dec">LBM.setLogger()</a> for Java and .NET).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Informatica requests that all logger callbacks be logged.</b> </li>
</ul>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">The application calls UM API functions. Each function can return a failed status. In C, the failure is almost always indicated by a return value of -1. In Java and .NET, the failure is almost always indicated by throwing an exception. In either case, UM provides a text string that describes the failure. See <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.14_RC6/doc/Operations/api.tag:../API/" href="../API/lbm_8h.html#a22a4650d3a5b649c84a0c05adedcc055">lbm_errmsg()</a> for C, the exception's <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Throwable.html#toString()">toString()</a> method for Java, or the exception's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.exception.message?view=net-5.0">Message property</a> for .NET).</p>

<li>
<b>Informatica requests that all failed API calls be logged with their descriptive text.</b> </li>
</ul>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">Log files are typically "rolled" (saved and re-created) on a periodic basis (usually daily), and are kept for some period of time before being deleted.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Informatica requests that full logs be retained for at least 1 week.</b> </li>
</ul>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">Recording and saving all this information is necessary to diagnose many user-visible problems. However, errors can be written to the log which are not associated with a user-visible problem. Users should have tools and procedures that alert operators of abnormal logs. This can prevent small problems from becoming big problems.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="monitoringumdaemons"></a>
Monitoring UM Daemons&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#monitoringumdaemons">&lt;-</a></small></h1>
<p>Monitoring the UM daemons is similar to monitoring user applications. Log files and UM library statistics should be monitored.</p>
<p>Monitoring a daemon's UM library statistics typically involves publishing those statistics to a <a class="el" href="monitoring.html#centralizedcollector">Centralized Collector</a>. The statistics are sampled and published using UM's <a class="el" href="monitoring.html#automaticmonitoring">Automatic Monitoring</a> feature.</p>
<p>For log files, Informatica requests the use of a log file analysis tool that scans the live log files and reports unusual or exceptional logs and raises alerts that will be noticed by the operations staff.</p>
<p>(There are many third party real-time log file analysis tools available. A discussion of possible tools is beyond the scope of UM documentation.)</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="automaticmonitoring"></a>
Automatic Monitoring&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#automaticmonitoring">&lt;-</a></small></h1>
<p>UM applications and UM daemons (Store and DRO) make use of the UM library, which maintains a rich set of statistics. The library statistics consists of data about the health and operation of UM contexts, transport sessions, and event queues.</p>
<p>The recommended method for monitoring UM library statistics is the automatic monitoring feature. This should be enabled via configuration on user applications and also Store and DRO daemons. See <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.14_RC6/doc/Operations/config.tag:../Config/" href="../Config/grpautomaticmonitoring.html">Automatic Monitoring Options</a>.</p>
<p>Note that monitoring has a single instance per process. The configuration options are context-scoped, but do not allow different settings per context. The first context created will define the settings related to automatic monitoring.</p>
<p>Enabling the automatic monitoring feature will create a context that is configured for reduced system resource usage (sockets and memory). This monitoring context periodically wakes up and samples the library statistics in the current process and publishes them.</p>
<p>Informatica recommends setting up a separate <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.14_RC6/doc/Operations/design.tag:../Design/" href="../Design/fundamentalconcepts.html#topicresolutiondomain">Topic Resolution Domain</a> for monitoring data. If possible, that TRD should be hosted on a separate network from the main production network (perhaps an administrative "command and control" network). This minimizes the impact of monitoring on application throughput and latency.</p>
<p>To ease the deployment of monitoring data on an alternate network, Informatica recommends not using multicast. Topic resolution should use <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.14_RC6/doc/Operations/design.tag:../Design/" href="../Design/topicresolutiondescription.html#unicastudptr">Unicast UDP TR</a> or <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.14_RC6/doc/Operations/design.tag:../Design/" href="../Design/topicresolutiondescription.html#tcptr">TCP TR</a> (or both).</p>

 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="automaticmonitoringrecommendations"></a>
Automatic Monitoring Recommendations&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#automaticmonitoringrecommendations">&lt;-</a></small></h2>
<p>The recommended settings to enable automatic monitoring are: </p><pre class="fragment">context     monitor_format pb
                 (only with UM versions 6.14 and beyond)

</pre><p>The 10 minute (600-second) monitoring interval was chosen somewhat arbitrarily; shorter times produce extra data without much extra benefit. However, UM networks with many thousands of applications may need a longer interval - maybe 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Also, the use of "en0" to define the interface can be done in different ways. See <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.14_RC6/doc/Operations/config.tag:../Config/" href="../Config/generalconfigurationguidelines.html#specifyinginterfaces">Specifying Interfaces</a>.</p>
<p>Note that applications running pre-6.14 versions of UM can be configured for automatic monitoring, but not for "monitor_format pb". UM supports a mixture of different versions, with the centralized collector accepting both old and new formats.</p>

 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="centralizedcollector"></a>
Centralized Collector&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#centralizedcollector">&lt;-</a></small></h1>
<p>Once you have applications and daemons publishing statistics, you need an independent program (the monitoring collector) that subscribes to the statistics and records them for subsequent analysis and display.</p>
<p>UM supports two approaches to centralized monitoring: </p><ul>
<li>
<a class="el" href="monitoring.html#monitoringcollectorservicemcs">Monitoring Collector Service (MCS)</a>. Informatica's monitoring program that collects library and daemon statistics for storage in a database. </li>
<li>
<a class="el" href="monitoring.html#userdevelopedcollector">User-Developed Collector</a>. Your own centralized monitoring program that collects library and daemon statistics for storage and analysis. </li>
</ul>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="monitoringcollectorservicemcs"></a>
Monitoring Collector Service (MCS)&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#monitoringcollectorservicemcs">&lt;-</a></small></h2>
<p>The MCS is an independent monitoring data collector program. It subscribes to UM library and daemon statistics and writes the data to a database.</p>
<p>The MCS needs to be configured. It has an XML configuration file; see <a class="el" href="mcsconfigurationfile.html">MCS Configuration File</a>. In this configuration file, the <a class="el" href="mcsconfigurationfile.html#mcselementconfigfile">MCS Element "&lt;config-file&gt;"</a> references an LBM configuration file.</p>
<p>See <a class="el" href="manpagesformcs.html">Man Pages for MCS</a> for information on running the MCS.</p>
<p>As of UM 6.14, the MCS supports writing to <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> (the default) or <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/">HDFS (Apache Hadoop)</a>, selectable by configuration. Note that UM does not ship with a copy of either database software package. The user must install a copy of the desired database on the host where MCS will run.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="mcssqlite"></a><b>SQLite</b></p>
<p>To use SQLite, you must install it yourself on the host where MCS is intended to run. You should have some familiarity with administering the system. Training you on SQLite's use is beyond the scope of UM documentation.</p>
<p>MCS is written to convert incoming proto buff messages into JSON, and write the JSON to SQLite using SQLite's jdbc driver. This allows flexible querying of the data.</p>
<p>You will find the MCS executable the UM package's "bin" directory, along with the other daemon binaries. Also in that directory, you will find the file "ummon_db.sql" which can be used to create the database.</p>
<p>Here is the contents of "ummon_db.sql" as of UM version 6.14: </p><pre class="fragment">PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF;

Also set <a class="el" href="mcsconfigurationfile.html#mcselementpropertiesfile">MCS Element "&lt;properties-file&gt;"</a> to a file which contains properties that the MCS's "sqlite" connector expects: </p><ul>
<li>
sqlite_database_path - file path to the SQLite database file. If on Windows, you may use forward slashes or escaped (double) back slashes to separate directories. </li>
</ul>
<p>Example sqlite properties file: </p><pre class="fragment">sqlite_database_path=/mcs/ummon.db
</pre><p><a class="anchor" id="mcshdfs"></a><b>HDFS</b></p>
<p>To use HDFS, you must install it yourself on the host where MCS is intended to run. You should have some familiarity with administering the system. Training you on HDFS's use is beyond the scope of UM documentation.</p>
<p>MCS is written to write the protocol buffers directly to HDFS. This allows flexible querying of the data.</p>
<p>You will find the MCS executable the UM package's "bin" directory, along with the other daemon binaries.</p>
<p>To use HDFS, set <a class="el" href="mcsconfigurationfile.html#mcselementconnector">MCS Element "&lt;connector&gt;"</a> to "hdfs".

<h2><a class="anchor" id="userdevelopedcollector"></a>
User-Developed Collector&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#userdevelopedcollector">&lt;-</a></small></h2>
<p>Some UM users take the either the <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.14_RC6/doc/Operations/example.tag:../example/" href="../example/index.html#examplelbmmon_c">Example lbmmon.c</a> or the <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.14_RC6/doc/Operations/java_example.tag:../java_example/" href="../java_example/index.html#examplelbmmon_java">Example lbmmon.java</a> source file and modify it to create a monitoring application that record received statistics. If you have done this using a pre-6.14 version of UM, you may want to enhance your program to take advantage of capabilities introduced in 6.14.</p>
<p>Prior to UM version 6.14, different types of published data required different methods for receiving and accessing them. UM library statistics were received using the "lbmmon" library, Store and DRO daemon stats were received as C-style binary data structures, and SRS stats were received as JSON.</p>
<p>Starting with 6.14, library, Store, and DRO stats have been unified with <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">Google Protocol Buffers</a>.</p>
<p>Also, the lbmmon library is enhanced with a "passthrough" mode that gives the monitoring application direct access to the protocol buffer messages. (The SRS daemon statistics are not yet available as protocol buffers.)</p>
<p>The older methods are still functional, but they may not be further enhanced in the future. Informatica recommends migrating to the passthrough mode and the google protocol buffers. To take full advantage of its new capabilities, lbmmon should be run with command-line options: </p><pre class="fragment">  --format=pb --format-opts="passthrough=convert"
</pre><p> This allows lbmmon to receive both proto buff formatted data as well as CSV formatted data. CSV data is converted to proto buff before delivery to the monitoring application.</p>

Monitoring Formats&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#monitoringformats">&lt;-</a></small></h1>
<p>The UM library and UM daemons publish their statistics using several different message formats, depending on the type of data being sent. Starting with UM version 6.14, most of those formats are deprecated in favor of a unified message format based on <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">Google Protocol Buffers</a>.</p>
<p>The data formats are: </p><ul>
<li>
CSV - comma-separated values. Option for UM library statistics. </li>
<li>
Binary C-style data structures. Option for UM daemons Store and DRO daemon statistics. </li>
<li>
JSON. Option for SRS daemon statistics. </li>
<li>
Protocol Buffers. Option for UM library statistics, and Store and DRO daemon statistics. </li>
</ul>
<p>For applications and UM daemons, Informatica recommends protocol buffers. See <a class="el" href="monitoringumwiththelbmmonapi.html#monitoringformatmodules">Monitoring Format Modules</a>.</p>
<p>You can view and use the proto buff definition files at <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.14_RC6/doc/Operations/example.tag:../example/" href="../example/index.html#exampleprotocolfiles">Example Protocol Files</a>.

<p>This can make a difference for statistics that increase in value quickly, like <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.14_RC6/doc/Operations/api.tag:../API/" href="../API/structlbm__src__transport__stats__lbtrm__t__stct.html#ac9e8875bb28fa479cc3425a69b821fae">lbm_src_transport_stats_lbtrm_t_stct::bytes_sent</a>. On platforms where a "long int" is 32 bits, a high-rate transport session running for a few hours can reach that field's maximum value (4,294,967,295) and then "wrap" back to zero.</p>
<p>Also note that a few statistics represent the "minimum value seen", and are initialized to the maximum possible value. For example, <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.14_RC6/doc/Operations/api.tag:../API/" href="../API/structlbm__rcv__transport__stats__lbtrm__t__stct.html#a8ea05ee4effe7f8e41e45051741ee1c6">lbm_rcv_transport_stats_lbtrm_t_stct::nak_tx_min</a> is initialized to the maximum value for "unsigned long int". Thus, GCC on a 32-bit build or the Microsoft compiler will initialize it to 4,294,967,295 (2**32 - 1). GCC on a 64-bit build will initialize it to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (2**64 - 1).</p>
