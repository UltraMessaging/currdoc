<dl class="section attention"><dt>Attention</dt><dd><b>See the <a href="../../DocIntro=en.pdf">Documentation Introduction</a> for important information on copyright, patents, information resources (including Knowledge Base, and How To articles), Marketplace, Support, and other information about Informatica and its products.</b></dd></dl>
<p>It is important to monitor Ultra Messaging to ensure smooth operation. By tracking the changes in UM statistics over time, you may be able to predict and avoid future overloads. When contacting support to report anomalous behavior, recording UM statistics can greatly assist the support engineers' root cause analysis.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="monitoringtransportstatistics"></a>
Monitoring Transport Statistics</h2>
<p>Monitoring the activity on your UM transport sessions is the most important component of your UM monitoring effort. UM provides the following four methods to monitor your UM activities.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Use UM API function calls within your applications to retrieve statistics and deliver them to your monitoring application. </li>
<li>
Use the UM Monitoring API to more easily retrieve and send statistics to your monitoring application. </li>
<li>
Use Automatic Monitoring to easily employ the UM Monitoring API to monitor UM activity at an UM context level. </li>
<li>
Use the Ultra Messaging SNMP Agent and MIB (purchased separately to monitor statistics through a Network Management System). See The Ultra Messaging SNMP Agent for detailed information. </li>
</ul>
<p>Automatic Monitoring is the easiest method to implement using configuration options or environment variables. Since many topics can use multiple transport sessions, UM Monitoring doesn't provide transport information for individual topics. From an Operations point of view, however, the health and behavior of your transport sessions is more correlated to system performance. Although UM Monitoring also provides statistics on event queues, these statistics are more specific to a single application and not a system wide health indication.</p>
<p>The interval for collecting statistics should be as short as practical. A too-long interval can hide microbursts of traffic. However, a too-short interval can lead to massive amounts of statistical data which needs to be stored and processed.</p>
<p>Note that certain statistics are initialized to the maximum unsigned value for the fields, i.e. all bits set (-1 if printed signed). This special value indicates that the field has not yet been calculated. This is used for the "min" statistic in a "minimum / maximum" statistics pair. For example, nak_tx_min is initialized to the maximum unsigned long, while nak_tx_max is initialized to zero.</p>
<p>This section lists some of the more important transport statistics to monitor listed by transport type.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="lbtrmandlbtrureceiverstatistics"></a>
LBT-RM and LBT-RU Receiver Statistics</h3>
<p>Essentially, aside from msg_rcved and bytes_rcved, if any receiver statistics increment, a problem may exist. The following lists the most important statistics.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>naks_sent</b> means a transport has a gap in sequence numbers, which can be recoverable or unrecoverable loss. </li>
<li>
<b>unrecovered_txw</b> and unrecovered_tmo loss statistics. Indicates retransmissions not delivered to a receiver. (The receiving application will have received a LBM_MSG_UNRECOVERABLE_LOSS or LBM_MSG_UNRECOVERABLE_LOSS_BURST log message via its receive callback, which should be found in the streaming or API log file. </li>
<li>
<b>lbm_msgs_no_topic_rcved</b> indicates that receivers may be doing too much topic filtering (wasting CPU resource) because they are processing messages in which they have no interest. If this statistic is greater than 25% of msgs_rcvd, a problem may exist or topics may need to be distributed to different transport sessions. </li>
<li>
<b>dgrams_dropped_*</b> - Indicates the reception of invalid datagrams, e.g. a non-UM datagram or datagram from an incompatible version. </li>
</ul>
<p>For additional information, see <a class="el" href="index.html#monitoringreceivingstatistics">Monitoring Receiving Statistics</a>.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="lbtrmandlbtrusourcestatistics"></a>
LBT-RM and LBT-RU Source Statistics</h3>
<p>The following lists the most important statistics.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>rxs_sent</b> indicates that some lost messages are being recovered, but the reason for the loss should be investigated and corrected. </li>
<li>
<b>naks_shed</b> indicates the number of retransmission requests (NAKs) the source transport has not fulfilled, sending a NCF instead. This statistics can help pinpoint transport bottlenecks, such as the configuration options <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/config.tag:../../Config/" href="../../Config/grptransportlbtrmoperation.html#transportlbtrmretransmitratelimitcontext">transport_lbtrm_retransmit_rate_limit (context)</a> and <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/config.tag:../../Config/" href="../../Config/grptransportlbtruoperation.html#transportlbtruretransmitratelimitcontext">transport_lbtru_retransmit_rate_limit (context)</a>. </li>

<h3><a class="anchor" id="tcpstatistics"></a>
TCP Statistics</h3>
<p>Receiver statistic <b>lbm_msgs_no_topic_rcvd</b> indicates that receivers may be doing too much topic filtering (wasting CPU resource) because they are processing messages in which they have no interest. If this statistic is greater than 25% of msgs_rcvd, a problem may exist or topics may need to be distributed to different transport sessions.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="lbtipcstatistics"></a>
LBT-IPC Statistics</h3>
<p>Receiver statistic <b>lbm_msgs_no_topic_rcvd</b> indicates that receivers may be doing too much topic filtering (wasting CPU resource) because they are processing messages in which they have no interest. If this statistic is greater than 25% of msgs_rcvd, a problem may exist or topics may need to be distributed to different transport sessions.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="monitoringeventqueues"></a>
Monitoring Event Queues</h2>
<p>The following lists the most important statistics.</p>
<ul>
<li>
data_msgs &amp; events - Total data messages and events enqueued - check these not growing beyond pre-defined bounds </li>
<li>
age_mean &amp; age_max - If an application uses a receive-side event queue for message delivery rather than direct callbacks, this indicates average and longest time messages wait on that queue before the application starts processing them. </li>
<li>
data_msgs_svc_mean &amp; data_msgs_svc_max - indicates average and longest time the application spends processing each event-queued message. </li>
</ul>

<p><br />
 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="monitoringapplicationlogmessages"></a>
Monitoring Application Log Messages</h2>
<p>UM returns log messages to your application when conditions warrant. Your applications can decide what messages to collect and log. Most UM development teams are concerned with the efficiency and performance of their applications and therefore will log any messages returned to their applications from UM. It may be helpful to meet with your UM development team to learn exactly what they log and how best to monitor the log files. Ideally your UM development team includes a timestamp when they log a message, which can be important for comparison of disparate data, such as CPU information to transport statistics.</p>
<p>See the UM Log Messages section for individual messages and descriptions.</p>
<p>UM daemons (lbmrd, umestored, tnwgd) automatically log messages to the log files specified in their XML configuration files.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="monitoringthepersistentstoredaemonumestored"></a>
Monitoring the Persistent Store Daemon (umestored)</h2>
<p>With the UMP/UMQ products, the Persistent Store provides persistence services to UM sources and receivers. Multiple stores are typically configured in Quorum/Consensus. Monitor every store process.</p>
<p>Monitor the following for all stores. </p><ul>
<li>
Store log files </li>
<li>
Application events and log files </li>
<li>
Store's internal transport statistics </li>
<li>
Persistent Store daemon web monitor </li>
</ul>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="monitoringstorelogfile"></a>
Monitoring Store Log File</h3>
<p>The store generates log messages that are used to monitor its health and operation. There is some flexibility on where those log messages are written; see <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/ume.tag:../../UME/" href="../../UME/designingpersistenceapplications.html#storelogfile">Store Log File</a>. Each store daemon should have its own log file.</p>
<p>To prevent unbounded disk file growth, the Persistent Store log file can be configured to automatically roll. See <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/ume.tag:../../UME/" href="../../UME/designingpersistenceapplications.html#storerollinglogs">Store Rolling Logs</a> for more information.</p>
<p>The following lists critical things to monitor in a store log file:</p>
<ul>
<li>
aio_warnings - may indicate a problem with the disk (disk full, cannot write, etc.) </li>
<li>
Proxy source creation - indicates that a source 'went away'. This may be fine, but could also indicate an error condition. Discuss with your UM development team when this event is safe and when it indicates a problem. </li>
<li>
Rapid log file growth - Log files growing rapidly or growing much more rapidly than normal, may indicate a problem. Look at what types of messages are being written to the log at higher-than-normal rates to see where the issue might be. </li>
</ul>
<p>In application log files, look for LBM_SRC_EVENT_UME_REGISTRATION_ERROR messages. These can indicate many different problems that will prevent message persistence. See the UM Log Messages section for details.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="monitoringastoresinternaltransportstatistics"></a>
Monitoring a Store's Internal Transport Statistics</h3>
<p>Since umestored is a proprietary UM application developed with the UM API library, you can configure the daemon with automatic monitoring and then access transport statistics for the daemon's internal sources and receivers. To accomplish this, follow the procedure below.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Enable Automatic Monitoring in the UM configuration file cited in the umestored XML configuration file's "&lt;daemon&gt;" element. </li>
<li>
For each store configured in the umestored XML configuration file, add a "&lt;context-name&gt;" element. Automatic Monitoring then maintains complete transport statistics for each store at the interval set in the UM configuration file. </li>
</ol>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="persistentstorewebmonitor"></a>
Persistent Store Web Monitor</h3>
<p>For information about umestored statistics see <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/ume.tag:../../UME/" href="../../UME/storewebmonitor.html">Store Web Monitor</a>.</p>
<p>The web address of th Store Web Monitor is configured in the store XML configuration file. See <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/ume.tag:../../UME/" href="../../UME/configurationreferenceforumestored.html#daemonelement">Daemon Element</a>.</p>
<p>You can monitor the following information on the umestored Web Monitor:</p>
<ul>
<li>
List of stores the daemon is running. </li>
<li>
List of topics and wildcard topic patterns for each store, along with registration IDs for the sources sending on the topics. </li>
<li>
Source and receiver information for each topic. </li>
<li>
Ultra Messaging statistics or transport-level statistics for underlying receivers in the store. These are similar to the transport statistics mentioned earlier, however they indicate how the store is communicating with its sources for a given topic. For example, a non-zero number of naks_sent indicates that the store is experiencing some loss. </li>
</ul>
<p>TIP: You can build a script that executes the Linux wget command at a 5 second interval to get a web monitor screen shot and save it to a directory or file.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="persistentstoredaemonstatistics"></a>
Persistent Store Daemon Statistics</h3>
<p>The Persistent Store daemon has a simple web server which provides operational information. However, while the web-based presentation is convenient for manual, on-demand monitoring, it is not suitable for automated collection and recording of operational information for historical analysis.</p>
<p>Starting with UM version 6.11, a feature called "Daemon Statistics" has been added to the Store daemon. This feature supports the background publishing of their operational information via UM messages. System designers can now subscribe to this information for their own automated monitoring systems.</p>
<p>See <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/ume.tag:../../UME/" href="../../UME/storedaemonstatistics.html">Store Daemon Statistics</a> for general information on Daemon Statistics, followed by specific information regarding the Store.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="detectingpersistentstorefailures"></a>
Detecting Persistent Store Failures</h3>
<p>You can detect the loss of a store with the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Loss of the Persistent Store's Process ID (PID) </li>
<li>
Application log messages stating the loss of connection to the store </li>
</ul>
<p>Stores can also be "too busy" and therefore cannot service source and receiving applications. Sources declare a store inactive with the <b>LBM_SRC_EVENT_UME_STORE_UNRESPONSIVE</b> event when the store's activity timeout expires. This can be caused by the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Disk is too busy (or when the system starts swapping) </li>
<li>
The store is processing an overly-large load of recovery traffic. You may want to recommend that UM administrators consider a larger quorum / consensus group size. </li>
</ul>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="monitoringtheumrouterdaemontnwgd"></a>
Monitoring the UM Router Daemon (tnwgd)</h2>
<p>The Ultra Messaging UM Router links disjoint topic resolution domains by forwarding multicast and/or unicast topic resolution traffic ensuring that receivers on the "other" side of the UM Router receive the topics to which they subscribe. See the UM Dynamic Routing Guide for more details.</p>
<p>Understand UM Router (tnwgd) output traffic and WAN impacts - especially the use of rate limiters.</p>
<ul>
<li>
WAN overrun is the number one source of UM Router problems </li>
<li>
Test WAN link throughput to determine the real limits of the UM Router and environment </li>
<li>
Make sure WAN bandwidth can cope with UM and any other traffic </li>
</ul>
<p>Review and understand loss conditions unique to using a UM Router. Collaborate with your UM development team to ensure the correct tuning and configurations are applied for your messaging system. Also monitor latency over the UM Router with the UM sample application lbmpong routinely and monitor output.</p>
<p>Monitor the following for UM Routers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
UM Router log files </li>
<li>
Application events and log files </li>
<li>
UM Router internal transport statistics </li>

<h3><a class="anchor" id="umroutertransportstatistics"></a>
UM Router Transport Statistics</h3>
<p>Using the "&lt;monitor&gt;" element in a UM Router's XML configuration file, you can monitor the transport activity between the UM Router and its Topic Resolution Domain. The configuration also provides Context and Event Queue statistics. The statistics output identifies individual portals by name.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="umrouterwebmonitor"></a>
UM Router Web Monitor</h3>
<p>The UM Router web monitor provides access to a UM Router's portal and general statistics and information. The UM Router XML configuration file contains the location of the gateway web monitor. The default port is 15305.</p>
<p>A UM Router Web Monitor provides a web page for each endpoint and peer portal configured for the UM Router. Peer portals connect UM Routers and communicate only with other peer portals. Endpoint portals communicate with topic resolution domains. Each statistic display a value for units (messages or fragments) and bytes.</p>
<p>Important statistics you can monitor on the tnwgd Web Monitor include the following.</p>
<p><b>Endpoint Send Statistics</b></p>
<p>Increases in the Endpoint Send Statistics values indicate errors and problems. A separate statistic appears for each of the three types of topic message: transport topic, immediate topic, immediate topicless.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Fragments/bytes dropped due to blocking - Indicates inability to send due to a transport's rate controller. Message rates on other portals probably exceed the rate controller limit on the monitored portal. The UM Router's XML configuration file may need to be adjusted. </li>
<li>
Fragments/bytes dropped due to error - Indicates a possible network socket or memory failure. </li>
<li>
Fragments/Bytes Dropped Due To Fragment Size Error - Indicates a configuration error which should be corrected. Maximum datagram size for all transports must be the same throughout the network. Nonzero indicates fragments were received which were larger than the egress portal's maximum datagram size. </li>
<li>
Current/maximum data bytes enqueued - Indicates how much data is currently queued and indicates the maximum amount of data queued because the incoming rate exceeded what the TCP connection could handle. Results in a latency penalty. Size of the queue is limited, so if the limit is exceeded, messages are dropped due to blocking. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Peer Send Statistics</b></p>
<p>Increases in the Peer Send Statistics values indicate errors and problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Fragments/bytes (or messages/bytes) dropped (blocking) - The result of attempting to send too much data via the peer link. </li>
<li>
Fragments/bytes (or messages/bytes) dropped (not operational) - Peer connection not yet fully established. The UM Router peer could be down or starting up. </li>
<li>
Current/maximum data bytes enqueued - Indicates how much data is currently queued and indicates the maximum amount of data queued because the incoming rate exceeded what the TCP connection could handle. Results in a latency penalty. Size of the queue is limited, so if the limit is exceeded, messages are dropped due to blocking. </li>
<li>
<p class="startli">Messages or bytes Received / Fragments or bytes Forwarded - Increasing counters indicate communicating peers. Stagnant counters indicate a lack of traffic flow. A sender could be down, receivers on the remote side could have no interest for the topics, the peer connection could have failed.</p>

<p>You can detect the loss of a UM Router by the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Loss of the UM Router's Process ID (PID) </li>
<li>
Loss of the UM Router's Web Monitor (you can poll the UM Router's Web Monitor to be sure it is accessible.) </li>
<li>
Monitoring the performance of applications sending messages through the UM Router. <ul>
<li>
Are applications receiving the appropriate volume of data? </li>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="monitoringmessagingsystemresources"></a>
Monitoring Messaging System Resources</h2>
<p>In addition to monitoring UM activity, you must also consider the health and activity of your system resources.</p>
<ul>
<li>
CPU usage </li>
<li>
Memory Usage </li>
<li>
UDP loss (netstat -s) </li>
<li>

<h3><a class="anchor" id="persistentstoresystemconsiderations"></a>
Persistent Store System Considerations</h3>
<p>Consider the following system issues regarding Persistent Store monitoring.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="startli">Make sure that the environment in which a Persistent Store daemon (umestored) is started has enough available file descriptors for the number of sources in your environment. UM uses a minimum of 2 file descriptors per UM source in addition to normal UM file descriptors for transports and other objects. You can use ulimit in Linux and Process Explorer on Microsoft® Windows® to monitor file handles.</p>
<p class="endli">Note: The reduced-fd repository type uses 5 File Descriptors for the entire store, regardless of the number of topics, in addition to normal UM file descriptors for transports and other objects. Use of this repository type may impact performance. </p>
</li>
<li>
Monitor system resources (CPU usage, memory, disk space, wait%, memory swapping). </li>
<li>
If the system is about to start swapping, your resources are insufficient for the required system performance. Reconfiguration and/or additional resources will be required. </li>
</ul>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="sourcesoflatency"></a>
Sources of Latency</h3>
<p>The following are common sources of latency.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Loss and recovery </li>
<li>
Slow receivers </li>
<li>
Wildcard receivers with overly broad interest patterns </li>
<li>
High resource utilization </li>
<li>
'Busy' applications - messages backed up in event queues. Your UM Development Team can tell you if your UM applications use event queues. </li>
</ul>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="runtimediagnostics"></a>
Runtime Diagnostics</h3>
<p>Use the following to validate a healthy system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
UM monitoring metrics are active as a sign of liveness </li>
<li>
Pre-defined thresholds are not breached in the monitoring systems </li>
<li>
Application logs are clear of errors/warnings </li>
<li>
Required processes are running i.e. lbmrd </li>
<li>
General system resources are within pre-defined bounds i.e. CPU, memory, network stats (specific to the applications) </li>
<li>
Operating system e.g. UDP buffers for loss detection </li>
</ul>
<p>Use the following to validate the system is operating within acceptable limits.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Monitor memory usage and growth over time. <ul>
<li>
Applications with increasing memory could indicate a future problem </li>
<li>
Could indicate apps are misconfigured for required scalability </li>
<li>
Event queue growth (also UM metrics) </li>
<li>
Theoretical memory limits for 32-bit/64-bit processes, dependent on OS and language choice. </li>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="startupshutdownprocedures"></a>
Startup/Shutdown Procedures</h1>
<p>In a multicast environment, only the applications and monitoring tools need to be started. If using Persistence, the store daemon (umestored) also needs to be started. Likewise, use of the UM Router requires starting the UM Router daemon (tnwgd).</p>
<p>In a unicast-only environment, one or more resolver daemons (lbmrd) are typically required. It is recommended that you start the lbmrd before starting the applications.</p>
<p>Informatica recommends that you shutdown applications using UM sources and receivers cleanly, even though UM is able to cope with the ungraceful shutdown and restart of applications and UM daemons.</p>
<p>A failed assertion could lead to immediate application shutdown. If opting to restart a UM client or lbmrd, no other components need be restarted. Failed assertions should be logged with Informatica support.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="topicresolution"></a>
Topic Resolution</h2>
<p>Your UM development or administration team should anticipate the time and bandwidth required to resolve all topics when all applications initially start. This team should also establish any restarting restrictions.</p>
<p>Operations staff should not have any direct topic resolution tasks aside from monitoring the increased CPU and bandwidth usage.</p>
<p>Topic resolution is the discovery of a topic's transport session information by a receiver to enable the receipt of topic messages. Although in a multicast environment, topic resolution does not need to be started or shutdown, it does use network resources and can cause deaf receivers and other problems if not operating properly. See <em>Topic Resolution</em> in the <em>UM Concepts Guide</em> for more detailed information.</p>
<p>Applications cannot deliver messages until topic resolution completes. UM monitoring statistics are active before all topics resolve. In a large topic space approximately 10,000 topics) topic resolution messages may be 'staggered' or rate controlled, taking potentially several seconds to complete.</p>
<p>For example, 10,000 topics at the default value of 1,000 for <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/config.tag:../../Config/" href="../../Config/grpresolveroperation.html#resolverinitialadvertisementspersecondcontext">resolver_initial_advertisements_per_second (context)</a> will take 10 seconds to send out an advertisement for every topic. If all receiving applications have been started first, fully resolving all topics may not take much more than 10 seconds. The rate of topic resolution can also be controlled with the <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/config.tag:../../Config/" href="../../Config/grpresolveroperation.html#resolverinitialadvertisementbpscontext">resolver_initial_advertisement_bps (context)</a> configuration option. Topic advertisements contain the topic string and approximately 110 bytes overhead. Topic queries from receivers contain no overhead, only the topic string.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="indicationsofpossibleapplicationshutdown"></a>
Indications of Possible Application Shutdown</h2>
<p>A UM application shutdown may not be obvious immediately, especially if you are monitoring scores of applications. The following lists events that may indicate an application has shutdown.</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Process ID disappears. Consider a method to monitor all process IDs (PIDs). </li>
<li>
You notice the existence of a core dump file on the machine. </li>
<li>
UM statistics appear to reduce in volume or stop flowing. </li>
<li>
In an Application Log, one or more End Of Session (EOS) events signaling the cessation of a transport session. This may indicate a source application may have shut down. Your UM development team must explicitly log LBM_MSG_EOS events. Some EOS events may be delayed for some transports. </li>
<li>
In an Application Log, disconnect events (LBM_SRC_EVENT_DISCONNECT) for unicast transports (if implemented) indicate UM receiver applications have shutdown. </li>
</ul>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="unicasttopicresolverlbmrd"></a>
Unicast Topic Resolver (lbmrd)</h2>
<p>If not using multicast topic resolution, one or more instances of lbmrd must be started prior to stating applications. Unicast resolver daemons require an XML configuration file and multiple resolver daemons can be specified by your UM development team for resiliency. See UM Concepts Guide, Unicast Topic Resolution for more details.</p>
<p>Execute the following command on the appropriate machine to start a unicast topic resolver (lbmrd).</p>
<pre class="fragment">lbmrd --interface=ADDR -L daemon_logfile.out -p PORT lbmrd.cfg
</pre><p>To stop the resolver, use the kill command. If a unicast resolver daemon terminates, you need to restart it.</p>
<p>Observe the lbmrd logfile for errors and warnings</p>
<p>If running multiple lbmrds and an lbmrd in the list becomes inactive, the following log message appears:</p>
<pre class="fragment">unicast resolver "&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;" went inactive
</pre><p>If all unicast resolver daemons become inactive, the following log message appears:</p>
<pre class="fragment">No active resolver instances, sending via inactive instance
</pre><p>After all topics are resolved, daemons do not strictly need to be running unless you restart applications. Resolver daemons do not cache or persist state and do not require other shutdown maintenance.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="persistentstoreumestored"></a>
Persistent Store (umestored)</h2>
<p>Stores can operate in disk-backed or memory-only mode specified in the store's XML configuration file. Disk backed stores are subject to the limitations of the disk hardware. Stores should not be run on virtual machines and each store should have a dedicated disk. UM holds messages in memory until written to disk.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="startingastore"></a>

<li>
On Microsoft Windows®, monitor the umestored service. </li>
<li>

</ul>
<p>In disk mode, stores create two types of files.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Cache file - contains the actual persisted messages, and can grow to be very large over time. It is important to ensure that there is enough disk space to record the appropriate amount of persisted data. </li>
<li>
State file - contains information about the current state of each client connection and is much smaller. </li>
</ul>
<p>Stores do not create any files in memory-only mode.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="restartingastore"></a>
Restarting a Store</h3>
<p>Perform the following procedure to restart a store.</p>
<ol>
<li>
If the store is still running, kill the PID (Linux) or use the Windows Service Manager® to stop the Windows service. </li>
<li>
If you want a clean "start-of-day" start, delete the cache and state files. The location of these files is specified in the store's XML configuration file. </li>
<li>
Wait 20-30 seconds to let timeouts expire. Due to its use of connectionless protocols, Persistence depends upon timeouts. Therefore, do not rapidly restart the store. </li>
<li>
Run the command: "umestored config-file.xml". umestored automatically uses the existing cache and state files after a graceful shutdown and resumes as part of the current messaging stream at its last known position. </li>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="umroutertnwgd"></a>
UM Router (tnwgd)</h2>
<p>When a UM Router starts it discovers all sources and receivers in the topic resolution domains to which it connects. This results in a measurable increase and overall volume of topic resolution traffic and can take some time to complete depending upon the number of sources, receivers, and topics. The rate limits set on topic resolution also affect the time to resolve all topics.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="monitoringintroduction"></a>
Monitoring Introduction</h2>
<p>Messaging systems often employ real-time monitoring and rapid human intervention to prevent the system from becoming unstable. The design of UM encourages stable operation by allowing you to pre-configure how UM will use resources under all traffic and network conditions. Hence manual intervention is not required when those conditions occur.</p>
<p>Monitoring UM still fills important roles other than maintaining stable operation. Chiefly among these are capacity planning and a better understanding of the latency added by UM as it recovers from loss. Collecting accumulated statistics from all sources and all receivers once per day is generally adequate for these purposes.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="whymonitor"></a>
Why Monitor?</h3>
<p>Monitoring can aid different groups within an organization.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Developers can spot bugs that impact system performance. </li>
<li>
Performance tuning groups can pinpoint under-performing receivers. </li>
<li>
Testing groups can understand the reaction of a system to stresses like random packet loss during pre- production testing. </li>
<li>
Network or middleware management groups can use monitoring to ensure a production system continues to operate within its design criteria. </li>
</ul>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="whattomonitor"></a>
What to Monitor</h3>
<p>Before discussing the monitoring statistics that are built into UM, we mention two things that are probably more important to monitor: connectivity and latency. UM provides some assistance for monitoring these, but the final responsibility rests with your applications.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt><b>Connectivity</b> </dt><dd>If you monitor only one thing, monitor connectivity, defined as the ability of your system components to talk to each other when needed Connectivity failures generally indicate a software, hardware, or network failure and generally require prompt attention. UM features like End Of Source (EOS) events, new source notifications, and receiver connect/disconnect events may help in application connectivity monitoring. See the lbmprice.c example to see techniques for using these to build an awareness of when components of the system come and go.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt><b>Message</b> Latency</dt><dd>If you monitor only two things, monitor connectivity and the latency of every message. Connectivity monitoring will catch the hard failures and latency monitoring will catch the soft failures. Many impending hard failures in hardware, software, and networks show up first as rises in average latency or as latency spikes.</dd></dl>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="monitoringmethods"></a>
Monitoring Methods</h2>
<p>UM provides the following methods to monitor your UM activities.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Use UM API function calls within your applications to retrieve statistics and deliver them to your monitoring application. </li>
<li>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="umsmonitoringapi"></a>
UM Monitoring API</h2>
<p>The UM Monitoring API (see <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbmmon_8h.html">lbmmon.h</a> or the LBMMonitor classes in the Java API and the .NET API) provides a framework to easily gather UM transport statistics and send them to a monitoring or reporting application. Transport sessions for sources and receivers, along with all transport sessions for a given context can be monitored. This API can be implemented in one of two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Build monitoring into your application with the UM Monitoring API functions. </li>
<li>
Turn on Automatic Monitoring with UM configuration options. See <a class="el" href="index.html#automaticmonitoring">Automatic Monitoring</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>An application requesting transport monitoring is called a monitor source, and an application accepting statistics is a monitor receiver. These monitoring objects deal only with transport session statistics and should not be confused with UM sources and UM receivers, which deal with UM messages. Statistics for both UM sources and UM receivers can be forwarded by a monitor source application.</p>
<p>Both a monitor source and monitor receiver comprise three modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
A format module, responsible for serializing and de-serializing the statistics. The proper transmission between monitor source and monitor receiver requires this serialization. </li>
<li>
A transport module that is responsible for sending and receiving statistics data. </li>
<li>
A control module, responsible for gathering the statistics, and calling the appropriate functions from the format and transport modules. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can substitute format and transport modules of your own choosing or creation. UM Monitoring provides the following sample modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
LBMMON CSV format module </li>
<li>
LBMMON UM transport module </li>
<li>
LBMMON UDP transport module </li>
<li>
LBMMON SNMP transport module </li>
</ul>
<p>To view the source code for all LBMMON transport modules, see LBMMON Example Source Code found on the Related Pages tab in the C Application Programmer's Interface.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="monitoringprocessflow"></a>
Monitoring Process Flow</h3>
<p>The overall process flow appears in the diagram below.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="lbmmon.png" alt="lbmmon.png"/>
</div>
 <ol>
<li>
Your application creates the monitor source controller, specifying the format and transport modules to use. It also calls lbmmon functions to start monitoring an UM context, UM source or UM receiver. </li>
<li>
The monitor source controller passes those statistics to the format module serialization function. </li>
<li>
The monitor source controller passes the resulting serialized data to the transport module send function. </li>
<li>
The transport module transmits the data over some transport medium (such as a network). </li>
<li>
The monitor receiver controller transport module receives the serialized data. (Your monitoring application has already created the monitor receiver controller specifying the format and transport modules to use, along with the application callback functions to use upon the receipt of UM source or UM receiver statistics data.) </li>
<li>
The monitor receiver controller calls the format module's de-serialization function. </li>
<li>
Finally, the monitor receiver controller passes the statistics to your monitoring application via the specified application callback functions. </li>
</ol>
<p>Your applications only calls functions in the controller modules, which calls the appropriate functions in the transport and format modules.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="apiframeworkflexibility"></a>
API Framework Flexibility</h3>
<p>The segregation of UM Monitoring into control, format, and transport modules provides flexibility for monitor receivers in two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Allows you to use languages for which no UM API or binding exists. </li>
<li>
Allows you to use monitoring products which do not integrate with UM. </li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, assume you have a Perl application which currently gathers statistics from other network applications (or, you are simply most comfortable working in Perl for such tasks). There is no Perl binding for UM. However, Perl can handle UDP packets very nicely, and can pick apart CSV data easily. By implementing a UDP transport module to be used by the monitor sources, your Perl application can read the UDP packets and process the statistics.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="initialmonitoringquestions"></a>
Initial Monitoring Questions</h3>
<p>If you can answer the following questions, you're already on your way.</p>
<ol>
<li>
What format module will you use? LBMMON CSV Format module or a different one. </li>
<li>
What transport module will you use? One of the 3 LBMMON modules or a different one. </li>
<li>
Do you want to monitor individual sources/receivers, or an entire context? The difference is in how the statistics are aggregated. <ul>
<li>
Monitoring a context aggregates transport statistics for all sources and receivers associated with a context, by transport. Note that this is not by transport type. The default configuration for TCP, for example, allocates up to 10 ports, forming up to 10 separate transport sessions. Absent any specific instructions, UM allocates sources and receivers to these 10 transports in a round-robin fashion. So the statistics for a specific transport on a context will aggregate all sources and receivers which use that specific transport. </li>
<li>
Ultra Messaging recommends that you monitor either a context or source/receiver, but not both. For example if Topic1 and Topic2 are mapped to the same transport session (which is the only transport session for the context) and you monitor both the receivers and the context, you will get 3 identical sets of statistics: one for Topic1 reporting the stats for it's transport session, one for Topic2 reporting the stats for the same transport session, and one for the transport session via the context. </li>
<li>
In the case of wildcard receivers, only the context may be monitored. UM creates wildcard receivers dynamically as it detects topics which match the wildcard pattern. The application does not have access to these dynamically-created receivers. So the only way to monitor a wildcard receiver is to monitor the context on which it was created. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Should statistics be sent automatically, or on demand? <ul>
<li>
Automatic sending of statistics is by far the simplest approach. You simply indicate how often the statistics should be gathered and sent. The rest is taken care of. </li>
<li>
On-demand is somewhat more involved. Your application decides when statistics should be gathered and sent. If you intend to use the arrival of statistics as a type of heartbeat, this is the method you should use. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following sections present more discussion and sample source code about starting monitor sources, monitor receivers and the LBMMON format and transport modules.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="creatingamonitoringsource"></a>
Creating a Monitoring Source</h3>
<p>The following examples demonstrate how to use the UM Monitoring API to enable monitoring in your application.</p>
<p>First, create a monitoring source controller:</p>
<pre class="fragment">lbm_context_t * ctx;
lbm_src_t * src;
lbm_rcv_t * rcv;
lbmmon_sctl_t * monctl;

if (lbmmon_sctl_create(&amp;monctl, lbmmon_format_csv_module(), NULL, lbmmon_transport_lbm_module(), NULL) == -1)
{
  fprintf(stderr, "lbmmon_sctl_create() failed\n");
  exit(1);
}
</pre><p>The above code tacitly assumes that the ctx, src, and rcv variables have been previously assigned via the appropriate UM API calls.</p>
<p>The monitoring source controller object must be passed to subsequent calls to reference a specific source controller. One implication of this is that it is possible to have multiple monitoring source controllers within a single application, each perhaps monitoring a different set of objects.</p>
<p>In the above example, the default CSV format module and default UM transport module are specified via the provided module functions lbmmon_format_csv_module() and lbmmon_transport_lbm_module().</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="specifyingtheobjecttomonitor"></a>
Specifying the Object to Monitor</h3>
<p>Once a monitoring source controller is created, the application can monitor a specific context using:</p>
<pre class="fragment">if (lbmmon_context_monitor(monctl, ctx, NULL, 10) == -1)
{
  fprintf(stderr, "lbmmon_context_monitor() failed\n");
  exit(1);
}
</pre><p>The above example indicates that statistics for all transports on the specified context will be gathered and sent every 10 seconds.</p>
<p>A UM source can be monitored using:</p>
<pre class="fragment">if (lbmmon_src_monitor(monctl, src, NULL, 10) == -1)
{
  fprintf(stderr, "lbmmon_src_monitor() failed\n");
  exit(1);
}
</pre><p>Finally, an UM receiver can be monitored using:</p>
<pre class="fragment">if (lbmmon_rcv_monitor(monctl, rcv, NULL, 10) == -1)
{
  fprintf(stderr, "lbmmon_rcv_monitor() failed\n");
  exit(1);
}
</pre><p>The two above examples also request that statistics for all transports on the specified source or receiver be gathered and sent every 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Statistics can also be gathered and sent in an on-demand manner. Passing 0 for the Seconds parameter to <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbmmon_8h.html#afe461c7e4c25b9af6e17e86ec6c68ca9">lbmmon_context_monitor()</a>, <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbmmon_8h.html#a17c8902529e1ada7f2c93807824f3186">lbmmon_src_monitor()</a>, or <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbmmon_8h.html#a6003e89b269f91cb2b54a848fc49ed0f">lbmmon_rcv_monitor()</a> prevents the automatic gathering and sending of statistics. To trigger the gather/send process, use:</p>
<pre class="fragment">lbmmon_sctl_sample(monctl);
</pre><p>Such a call will perform a single gather/send action on all monitored objects (contexts, sources, and receivers) which were registered as on-demand.</p>
<p>As part of application cleanup, the created monitoring objects should be destroyed. Each individual object can be de-registered using <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbmmon_8h.html#a9c9df74b579a8d671cc35ae0a45dc712">lbmmon_context_unmonitor()</a>, <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbmmon_8h.html#accdc082c8a0335ada54924517bdab61e">lbmmon_src_unmonitor()</a>, or <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbmmon_8h.html#aec702c07918485584dbf3f1c837a0945">lbmmon_rcv_unmonitor()</a>.

The options are passed via the TransportOptions parameter to the <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbmmon_8h.html#a393a4f0563c7dbda75582053c3a56209">lbmmon_sctl_create()</a> and <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbmmon_8h.html#a3c327a6086714f1cbdb0b95905457043">lbmmon_rctl_create()</a> functions, as a null-terminated string containing semicolon-separated name/value pairs.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../example/lbmmon.c">lbmmon.c</a> example program's command-line option "--transport-opts" is used for the TransportOptions string for the LBM transport module.</p>
<p>The following name/value pairs are available:</p>

Instead, the options parsed from the configuration file are applied only to the UM objects created by the module. </li>
<li>
<b>topic=topic_name</b> specifies the topic name to use for sending and receiving statistics. By default, the topic <code>/29west/statistics</code> is used. </li>
<li>
<b>wctopic=topic_pattern</b> specifies (for monitor receivers only) a wildcard pattern to be used to receive statistics. </li>
<li>
<b>context|option_name=option_value</b> specifies UM a configuration option for the monitoring context. </li>
<li>
<b>source|option_name=option_value</b> specifies UM a configuration option for the source used to publish monitoring data. </li>
<li>
<b>receiver|option_name=option_value</b> specifies UM a configuration option for the receiver used to subscribe to monitoring data. </li>
<li>
<b>wildcard_receiver|option_name=option_value</b> specifies UM a configuration option for the wildcard receiver used to subscribe to monitoring data. </li>

The options are passed via the TransportOptions parameter to the <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbmmon_8h.html#a393a4f0563c7dbda75582053c3a56209">lbmmon_sctl_create()</a> and <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbmmon_8h.html#a3c327a6086714f1cbdb0b95905457043">lbmmon_rctl_create()</a> functions, as a null-terminated string containing semicolon-separated name/value pairs.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../example/lbmmon.c">lbmmon.c</a> example program's command-line option "--transport-opts" is used for the TransportOptions string for the UDP transport module.</p>
<p>The UDP module supports sending and receiving via UDP unicast, UDP broadcast, and UDP multicast. The following name/value pairs are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>address=dest_ip</b> specifies the unicast IP address to which statistics are sent via UDP. Applicable to sender only. </li>
<li>
<b>port=port_num</b> is the IP port packets are sent to. Defaults to 2933. </li>
<li>
<b>interface=interface_spec</b> specifies the network interface over which multicast UDP is sent or received.

Automatic Monitoring</h2>
<p>Instead of building a monitoring capability into your application using the UM Monitoring API, automatic monitoring allows you to easily produce monitoring statistics with the UM Monitoring API by setting a few simple UM configuration options. Automatic monitoring does not require any changes to your application. See <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/config.tag:../../Config/" href="../../Config/grpautomaticmonitoring.html">Automatic Monitoring Options</a> for more information.</p>
<p>You can enable Automatic Monitoring for either or both of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Transport Statistics - Automatic monitoring of transport statistics reflect data for all the transport sessions within the UM context. You cannot, however, receive statistics for an individual transport session. Essentially, you turn on automatic monitoring of a context's transport sessions by configuring <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/config.tag:../../Config/" href="../../Config/grpautomaticmonitoring.html#monitorintervalcontext">monitor_interval (context)</a>. The use of the Ultra Messaging SNMP Agent requires configuring <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/config.tag:../../Config/" href="../../Config/grpautomaticmonitoring.html#monitortransportcontext">monitor_transport (context)</a> to <b>lbmsnmp</b>. </li>
<li>
Event Queue Statistics - Automatic Monitoring of Event Queues provides statistics for all the Event Queues within the UM context. You turn on automatic monitoring of a context's Event Queues by configuring <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/config.tag:../../Config/" href="../../Config/grpautomaticmonitoring.html#monitorintervaleventqueue">monitor_interval (event_queue)</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can also set environment variables to turn on automatic monitoring for all UM contexts (transports and event queues).</p>

Monitoring Examples</h2>
<p>This section demonstrates the use of the two UM monitoring example applications described in the <a href="../../example/index.html">C examples</a>. We present advice based on what we have seen productively monitored by customers and our own knowledge of transport statistics that might be of interest. Of course, what you choose to monitor depends on your needs so merge these thoughts with your own needs to determine what is best for you.</p>

 </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="lbmmonc"></a>
lbmmon.c</h3>
<p>The example application <a href="../../example/lbmmon.c">lbmmon.c</a> acts as a Monitor Receiver and is provided in both executable and source form. It writes monitoring statistics to the screen and can be used in conjunction with other example applications (which act as the Monitor Sources). The following procedure uses lbmrcv and lbmsrc to create messaging traffic and adds a configuration file in order to specify the LBT-RM transport instead of the TCP default. (The LBT-RM transport displays more statistics than TCP.)</p>
<p>Since UM does not generate monitoring statistics by default, you must activate monitoring in your application. For the example application, use the <code>--monitor-ctx=n</code> option where n is the number of seconds between reports. The following procedure activates monitoring on the receiver, specifying the context (ctx) to create a complete set of receiver statistics. You could activate monitoring in a similar fashion on the source and create source statistics.</p>
<p>To use lbmmon to view statistics from sample application output:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Create configuration file with the single option of source transport lbtrm and name it LBTRM.cfg. </li>
<li>
Run <code>lbmmon --transport-opts="config=LBTRM.cfg"</code> </li>
<li>
Run <code>lbmrcv -c LBTRM.cfg --monitor-ctx="5" Arizona</code> </li>
<li>
Run <code>lbmsrc -c LBTRM.cfg Arizona</code> </li>
</ol>
<p>After lbmsrc completes, the final output for lbmmon should closely resemble the following:</p>

The <code>--transport-opt</code> command-line option is a string passed to the desired transport module.

Since this procedure was done on a single machine. No packets were lost and therefore lbmrcv did not generate any NAKs and lbmsrc did not send any NCFs. If you run this procedure across a network, packets may be lost and you would see statistics for NAKs, NCFs and loss recovery. </li>
<li>
This procedure activates monitoring on the receiver, specifying the context (<code>--monitor-ctx</code>) to create a complete set of receiver transport statistics. You could activate monitoring in a similar fashion on the source and create source statistics. Each set of statistics shows one side of the transmission. For example, source statistics contain information about NAKs received by the source (ignored, shed, retransmit delay, etc.) where receiver statistics contain data about NCFs received. Each view can be helpful. </li>
<li>
Moreover, as explained earlier in Specifying the Object to Monitor, individual receivers or sources can be monitored instead of all transport activity for a context. For this procedure, use <code>--monitor-rcv</code> or <code>--monitor-src</code>. </li>

You could run this procedure again specifying a different transport (LBT-RU or TCP) in the configuration file and receive a different set of statistics.

</ol>
<p>The following sections discuss some of the possible results of this procedure. Your results will vary depending upon conditions in your network or if you run the procedure on a single machine.</p>
<p><b>Severity 1 — Monitoring Unrecoverable Loss</b></p>
<p>The most severe system problems are often due to unrecoverable datagram loss at the reliable transport level. These are reported as severity 1 events by the lbmmondiag.pl example script. Many of the scalability and latency benefits of UM come from the use of reliable transport protocols like LBT-RM and LBT-RU. These protocols provide loss detection, retransmission, and recovery up to the limits specified by an application. Unrecoverable loss is reported by the transport when loss repair is impossible within the specified limits.</p>
<p>Unrecoverable transport loss often (but not always) leads to unrecoverable message loss so it is very significant to applications that benefit from lossless message delivery.</p>
<p>Unrecoverable loss can be declared by receivers when the <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/config.tag:../../Config/" href="../../Config/grptransportlbtrmreliability.html#transportlbtrmnakgenerationintervalreceiver">transport_lbtrm_nak_generation_interval (receiver)</a> has ended without receipt of repair. Each such loss event is recorded by incrementing the <b>unrecovered_tmo</b> field in <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbm_8h.html#a9bdc2628dece44f0675b0bdebfb3d52c">lbm_rcv_transport_stats_t</a>. Output from lbmmondiag.pl might look like this:</p>
<pre class="fragment">Sev1: 34 datagrams unrecovered due to NAK generation interval ending
</pre><p>Unrecoverable loss can also be triggered at receivers by notice from a source that the lost datagram has passed out of the source's transmission window. Each such loss event is recorded by incrementing the <b>unrecovered_txw</b> field in <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbm_8h.html#a9bdc2628dece44f0675b0bdebfb3d52c">lbm_rcv_transport_stats_t</a>. Output from lbmmondiag.pl might look like this:</p>
<pre class="fragment">Sev1: 249 datagrams unrecovered due to transmission window advancement
</pre><p><b>Severity 2 — Monitoring Rate Controller Activity</b></p>
<p>The data and retransmission rate controllers built into LBT-RM provide for stable operation under all traffic conditions. These rate controllers introduce some latency at the source since that is generally preferable to the alternative of NAK storms or other unstable states. The <b>lbmmondiag.pl</b> example script reports this activity as a severity 2 event since latency is normally the only effect of their operation.</p>
<p>Activity of the rate controller indicates that a source tried to send faster than the configured <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/config.tag:../../Config/" href="../../Config/grptransportlbtrmoperation.html#transportlbtrmdataratelimitcontext">transport_lbtrm_data_rate_limit (context)</a>. Normally, this limit is set to the speed of the fastest receivers. Sending faster than this rate would induce loss in all receivers so it is generally best to add latency at the source or avoid sending in such situations.</p>
<p>The current number of datagrams queued by the rate controller is given in the <b>rctlr_data_msgs</b> field in <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbm_8h.html#a0a0c54fd8e9a7008f1db0126373fca92">lbm_src_transport_stats_t</a>. No more than 10 datagrams are ever queued. Output from <b>lbmmondiag.pl</b> might look like this:</p>
<pre class="fragment">Sev2: 10 datagrams queued by data rate controller
</pre><p>Activity of the retransmission rate controller indicates that receivers have requested retransmissions in excess of the configured <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/config.tag:../../Config/" href="../../Config/grptransportlbtrmoperation.html#transportlbtrmretransmitratelimitcontext">transport_lbtrm_retransmit_rate_limit (context)</a>. Latency is added to retransmission requests in excess of the limit to control the amount of latency they may add to messages being sent the first time. This behavior avoids NAK storms.</p>
<p>The current number of datagrams queued by the retransmission rate controller is given in the <b>rctlr_rx_msgs</b> field in <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbm_8h.html#a0a0c54fd8e9a7008f1db0126373fca92">lbm_src_transport_stats_t</a>. No more than 101 datagrams are ever queued. Output from <b>lbmmondiag.pl</b> might look like this:</p>
<pre class="fragment">Sev2: 101 datagrams queued by retransmission rate controller
</pre><p><b>Severity 2 — Monitoring Loss Recovery Activity for a Receiver</b></p>
<p>It is important to monitor loss recovery activity because it always adds latency if the loss is successfully repaired. UM defaults generally provide for quite a bit of loss recovery activity before loss would become unrecoverable. Statistics on such activity are maintained at both the source and receiver. Unrecoverable loss will normally be preceded by a burst of such activity.</p>
<p>UM receivers measure the amount of time required to repair each loss detected. For each transport session, an exponentially weighted moving average is computed from repair times and the maximum and minimum times are tracked.</p>
<p>The total number of losses detected appears in the <b>lost</b> field in <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbm_8h.html#a9bdc2628dece44f0675b0bdebfb3d52c">lbm_rcv_transport_stats_t</a>. It may be multiplied by the average repair time given in the <b>nak_stm_mean</b> field in <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbm_8h.html#a9bdc2628dece44f0675b0bdebfb3d52c">lbm_rcv_transport_stats_t</a> to estimate of the amount of latency that was added to repair loss. This is probably the single most important metric to track for those interested in minimizing repair latency. The <b>lbmmondiag.pl</b> script reports this whenever the lost field changes and the average repair time is nonzero. Output might look like this:</p>
<pre class="fragment">Sev2: 310 datagrams lost
Sev2: 112.236 seconds estimated total latency due to repair of 564 losses
</pre><dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This estimate only includes latency added in the recovery of lost messages. Requiring ordered delivery also adds latency for all messages that arrive after the time of loss and before the time that repair arrives.</dd></dl>
<p>See the <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/config.tag:../../Config/" href="../../Config/grpmajoroptions.html#ordereddeliveryreceiver">ordered_delivery (receiver)</a> option to control this.</p>
<p>In addition to counting losses detected, UM reliable receivers also count the number of NAKs generated in the <b>naks_sent</b> field in <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbm_8h.html#a9bdc2628dece44f0675b0bdebfb3d52c">lbm_rcv_transport_stats_t</a>. Output from <b>lbmmondiag.pl</b> might look like this:</p>
<pre class="fragment">Sev2: 58 NAKs sent
</pre><p>Those who are new to reliable multicast protocols are sometimes surprised to learn that losses detected do not always lead to NAK generation. If a datagram is lost in the network close to the source, it is common for many receivers to detect loss simultaneously when a datagram following the loss arrives. Scalability would suffer if all receivers that detected loss reported it by generating a NAK at the same time. To improve scalability, a random delay is added to NAK generation at each receiver. Since retransmissions are multicast, often only one NAK is generated to repair the loss for all receivers. Thus it is common for the number of losses detected to be much larger than the number of NAKs sent, especially when there are many receivers with similar loss patterns.</p>
<p><b>Severity 2 — Monitoring Loss Recovery Activity for a Source</b></p>
<p>For sources, the principal concern is often understanding how much the retransmission of messages already sent at least once slowed down the source. Obviously, bandwidth and CPU time spent servicing retransmission requests cannot be used to send new messages. This is the way that lossy receivers add latency for lossless receivers.</p>
<p>UM sources track the number of NAKs received in the <b>naks_rcved</b> field in <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbm_8h.html#a0a0c54fd8e9a7008f1db0126373fca92">lbm_src_transport_stats_t</a>. The number of datagrams that they retransmit to repair loss is recorded in the <b>rxs_sent</b> field in <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbm_8h.html#a0a0c54fd8e9a7008f1db0126373fca92">lbm_src_transport_stats_t</a>.</p>
<p>The number of retransmitted datagrams may be multiplied by the average datagram size and divided by the wire speed to estimate the amount of latency added to new messages by retransmission. Output from the example lbmmondiag.pl script might look like this:</p>
<pre class="fragment">Sev2: 7478 NAKs received
Sev2: 50 retransmissions sent
Sev2: 0.015056 seconds estimated total latency due to retransmissions

Interpreting LBT-RM Source Statistics</h2>
<p>LBT-RM sources maintain many statistics that can be useful in diagnosing reliable multicast problems. See the UM API documentation <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/jenkins/backup_exclude.1/rc/UMQ_6.11.1_RC1/doc/Operations/api.tag:../../API/" href="../../API/lbm_8h.html#ad7cd86fcb1fc5cd16760106b11ba9e07">lbm_src_transport_stats_lbtrm_t</a> Structure Reference for a description of the fields. The remainder of this section gives advice on interpreting the statistics.</p>
<p>Divide <b>naks_rcved</b> by <b>msgs_sent</b> to find the likelihood that sending a message resulted in a NAK being received. Expect no more than a few percent on a network with reasonable loss levels.</p>
<p>Divide <b>rxs_sent</b> by <b>msgs_sent</b> to find the ratio of retransmissions to new data. Many NAKs arriving at a source will cause many retransmissions.</p>
<p>Divide <b>naks_shed</b> by <b>naks_rcved</b> to find the likelihood that excessive NAKs were ignored. Consider reducing loss to avoid NAK generation.</p>

UM Monitoring Statistics</h1>
<p>This section contains links to API documentation pages with detailed descriptions of each UM statistic.</p>
<p>Note that certain statistics are initialized to the maximum unsigned value for the fields, i.e. all bits set (-1 for a signed value). This special value indicates that the field has not yet been calculated. This is used for the "min" statistic in a "minimum / maximum" statistics pair. For example, nak_tx_min is initialized to the maximum unsigned long, while nak_tx_max is initialized to zero.</p>

Message Loss</h2>
<p>UM can recover message loss automatically but any recurring loss situation should be investigated and resolved.</p>
<p><b>Symptom</b></p>
<p>The receiving application monitoring statistic, lost, reports the number of datagrams detected as lost.</p>
<p>In addition, NAKing activity also indicates message loss, however, you could turn NAKing off. (If you are concerned about message loss, however, you should not turn it off.) Your source application monitoring statistics show values for <b>naks_rcved</b> or <b>nak_pckets_rcved</b>. Receiving application monitoring statistics show values for <b>naks_sent</b> or <b>nak_pckets_sent</b>. See <a class="el" href="index.html#monitoringtransportstatistics">Monitoring Transport Statistics</a>.</p>
<p><b>Cause</b></p>
<p>Message loss in source-paced transports (LBT-RM, LBT-RU) can occur due to the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Slow or overloaded receiver applications drop packets because, for example, the CPU can't service network interrupts or UDP socket buffers. </li>
<li>
An overloaded network infrastructure drops packets because of, for example, switch buffer overflows or NIC ring buffer overflows. </li>
<li>
A network component fails. </li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram depicts possible locations of message loss.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="Message-Loss-In-Buffers.png" alt="Message-Loss-In-Buffers.png"/>

 <p><b>Resolution</b></p>

Registration allows the source to begin sending, but the store does not actually begin listening for messages until it receives a topic advertisement from the source and sets up receivers for the appropriate topics.In that brief interval, the store will send these notices to the source, just in case you actually did forget to configure the store to listen to the correct topic resolution channel.Once the store receives a topic resolution advertisement and begins listening to the topic, the store will perform a Late Join recovery if the source has already started sending, and should be able to catch up unless you have changed your source's transmission window to a small value (by default, a source keeps 24 MB of data for retransmission).Our recommended delay before sending should prevent you from seeing this notice most of the time, but you may occasionally see it during store failover.</td><td></td></tr>
