<div class="textblock"><p>In a multicast environment, only the applications and monitoring tools need to be started. If using Persistence, the Store daemon (umestored) also needs to be started. Likewise, use of the DRO requires starting the DRO daemon (tnwgd).</p>
<p>In a unicast-only environment, one or more resolver daemons (lbmrd) are typically required. It is recommended that you start the lbmrd before starting the applications.</p>
<p>Informatica recommends that you shutdown applications using UM sources and receivers cleanly, even though UM is able to cope with the ungraceful shutdown and restart of applications and UM daemons.</p>
<p>A failed assertion could lead to immediate application shutdown. If opting to restart a UM client or lbmrd, no other components need be restarted. Failed assertions should be logged with Informatica support.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="topicresolution"></a>
Topic Resolution&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#topicresolution">&lt;-</a></small></h1>
<p>Your UM development or administration team should anticipate the time and bandwidth required to resolve all topics when all applications initially start. This team should also establish any restarting restrictions.</p>
<p>Operations staff should not have any direct topic resolution tasks aside from monitoring the increased CPU and bandwidth usage.</p>
<p>Topic resolution is the discovery of a topic's transport session information by a receiver to enable the receipt of topic messages. Although in a multicast environment, topic resolution does not need to be started or shutdown, it does use network resources and can cause deaf receivers and other problems if not operating properly. See <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/sford/backup_exclude/labbox/sfordmac_DEV_HF_6_14/29West/lbm/doc/Operations/design.tag:../Design/" href="../Design/fundamentalconcepts.html#topicresolutionoverview">Topic Resolution Overview</a> for more detailed information.</p>
<p>Applications cannot deliver messages until topic resolution completes. UM monitoring statistics are active before all topics resolve. In a large topic space approximately 10,000 topics) topic resolution messages may be 'staggered' or rate controlled, taking potentially several seconds to complete.</p>
<p>For example, 10,000 topics at the default value of 1,000 for <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/sford/backup_exclude/labbox/sfordmac_DEV_HF_6_14/29West/lbm/doc/Operations/config.tag:../Config/" href="../Config/grpudpbasedresolveroperation.html#resolverinitialadvertisementspersecondcontext">resolver_initial_advertisements_per_second (context)</a> will take 10 seconds to send out an advertisement for every topic. If all receiving applications have been started first, fully resolving all topics may not take much more than 10 seconds. The rate of topic resolution can also be controlled with the <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/sford/backup_exclude/labbox/sfordmac_DEV_HF_6_14/29West/lbm/doc/Operations/config.tag:../Config/" href="../Config/grpudpbasedresolveroperation.html#resolverinitialadvertisementbpscontext">resolver_initial_advertisement_bps (context)</a> configuration option. Topic advertisements contain the topic string and approximately 110 bytes overhead. Topic queries from receivers contain no overhead, only the topic string.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="umapplications"></a>
UM Applications&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#umapplications">&lt;-</a></small></h1>
<p>Your UM development team should provide you with the application names, resident machines and startup parameters, along with a sequence of application/daemon startups and shutdowns.</p>
<p>The following lists typical application startup errors.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Lack of resources </li>
<li>
License not configured - LOG Level 3: CRITICAL: LBM license invalid [LBM_LICENSE_FILENAME nor LBM_LICENSE_INFO are set] </li>
<li>
<p class="startli">Cannot bind port - lbm_context_create: could not find open TCP server port in range.</p>
<p>Too many applications may be running using the UM context's configured port range on this machine. This possibility should be escalated to your UM development team.</p>
<p class="endli">Application is possibly already running. It is possible to start more than one instance of the same UM application. </p>
</li>
<li>
Invalid network interface name / mask - lbm_config: line 1: no interfaces matching criteria </li>
<li>
Multiple interfaces detected - LOG Level 5: WARNING: Host has multiple multicast-capable interfaces; going to use [en1][10.10.10.102] </li>
</ul>
<p>This message appears for multi-homed machines. UM is not explicitly configured to use a single interface. This may not cause an issue but requires configuration review by your UM development team.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="indicationsofpossibleapplicationshutdown"></a>
Indications of Possible Application Shutdown&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#indicationsofpossibleapplicationshutdown">&lt;-</a></small></h1>
<p>A UM application shutdown may not be obvious immediately, especially if you are monitoring scores of applications. The following lists events that may indicate an application has shutdown.</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Process ID disappears. Consider a method to monitor all process IDs (PIDs). </li>
<li>
You notice the existence of a core dump file on the machine. </li>
<li>
UM statistics appear to reduce in volume or stop flowing. </li>
<li>
In an Application Log, one or more End Of Session (EOS) events signaling the cessation of a transport session. This may indicate a source application may have shut down. Your UM development team must explicitly log LBM_MSG_EOS events. Some EOS events may be delayed for some transports. </li>
<li>
In an Application Log, disconnect events (LBM_SRC_EVENT_DISCONNECT) for unicast transports (if implemented) indicate UM receiver applications have shutdown. </li>
</ul>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="unicasttopicresolverlbmrd"></a>
Unicast Topic Resolver (lbmrd)&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#unicasttopicresolverlbmrd">&lt;-</a></small></h1>
<p>If not using multicast topic resolution, one or more instances of lbmrd must be started prior to stating applications. Unicast resolver daemons require an XML configuration file and multiple resolver daemons can be specified by your UM development team for resiliency. For more information on Unicast Topic Resolution, see <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/sford/backup_exclude/labbox/sfordmac_DEV_HF_6_14/29West/lbm/doc/Operations/design.tag:../Design/" href="../Design/topicresolutiondescription.html#unicastudptr">Unicast UDP TR</a>.</p>
<p>Execute the following command on the appropriate machine to start a unicast topic resolver (lbmrd) from command line:</p>

<p>To stop an lbmrd that is running as a Windows service, use the Windows service control panel to stop it. Otherwise, kill the PID. If an lbmrd terminates, you need to restart it.</p>
<p>Observe the lbmrd logfile for errors and warnings</p>
<p>To make the lbmrd a Windows Service, see <a class="el" href="startupshutdownprocedures.html#umdaemonsaswindowsservices">UM Daemons as Windows Services</a>.</p>
<p>If running multiple lbmrds and an lbmrd in the list becomes inactive, the following message appears in the clients' log files:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">unicast resolver <span class="stringliteral">&quot;&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;&quot;</span> went inactive</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>If all unicast resolver daemons become inactive, the following message appears in the clients' log files:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">No active resolver instances, sending via inactive instance</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>After all topics are resolved, daemons do not strictly need to be running unless you restart applications. Resolver daemons do not cache or persist state and do not require other shutdown maintenance.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="persistentstoreumestored"></a>
Persistent Store (umestored)&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#persistentstoreumestored">&lt;-</a></small></h1>
<p>Stores can operate in disk-backed or memory-only mode specified in the Store's XML configuration file. Disk backed Stores are subject to the limitations of the disk hardware. Stores should not be run on virtual machines and each Store should have a dedicated disk. UM holds messages in memory until written to disk.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="startingastore"></a>
Starting a Store&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#startingastore">&lt;-</a></small></h2>

<div class="fragment"><div class="line">umestored config-file.xml</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>For more information on the umestored command-line, see <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/sford/backup_exclude/labbox/sfordmac_DEV_HF_6_14/29West/lbm/doc/Operations/ume.tag:../UME/" href="../UME/manpagesforstore.html#umestoredmanpage">Umestored Man Page</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Record umestored PID to monitor process presence for failure detection. </li>
<li>
On Microsoft Windows, monitor the umestored service. </li>
<li>
Observe the umestored logfile for errors and warnings </li>
</ul>
<p>In disk mode, Stores create two types of files.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Cache file - contains the actual persisted messages, and can grow to be very large over time. It is important to ensure that there is enough disk space to record the appropriate amount of persisted data. </li>
<li>
State file - contains information about the current state of each client connection and is much smaller. </li>
</ul>
<p>Stores do not create any files in memory-only mode.</p>
<p>To make the Store a Windows Service, see <a class="el" href="startupshutdownprocedures.html#umdaemonsaswindowsservices">UM Daemons as Windows Services</a>.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="restartingastore"></a>
Restarting a Store&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#restartingastore">&lt;-</a></small></h2>
<p>Perform the following procedure to restart a Store.</p>
<ol>
<li>
If the Store is running as a Windows service, use the Service Manager to stop the Windows service. Otherwise kill the PID. </li>
<li>
If you want a clean "start-of-day" start, delete the cache and state files. The location of these files is specified in the Store's XML configuration file. </li>
<li>
Wait 20-30 seconds to let timeouts expire. Due to its use of connectionless protocols, Persistence depends upon timeouts. Therefore, do not rapidly restart the Store. </li>
<li>
Run the command: "umestored config-file.xml". umestored automatically uses the existing cache and state files after a graceful shutdown and resumes as part of the current messaging stream at its last known position. </li>
</ol>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="umroutertnwgd"></a>
DRO (tnwgd)&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#umroutertnwgd">&lt;-</a></small></h1>
<p>When a DRO starts it discovers all sources and receivers in the topic resolution domains to which it connects. This results in a measurable increase and overall volume of topic resolution traffic and can take some time to complete depending upon the number of sources, receivers, and topics. The rate limits set on topic resolution also affect the time to resolve all topics.</p>

</table>
<p>Note that the Ultra Messaging Manager daemon (<code>"ummd"</code>) is not offered as a Windows Service at this time.</p>
<p>Also note that the UM daemons were not designed to run multiple instances of the service on the same host. See <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/sford/backup_exclude/labbox/sfordmac_DEV_HF_6_14/29West/lbm/doc/Operations/changelog.tag:../ChangeLog/" href="../ChangeLog/knownlimitations.html#bug9337">known limitation 9337</a>.</p>
<p>As of UM version 6.12 and beyond, the above UM daemons work similarly with respect to running as a Windows Service. See the individual man pages for differences.</p>
<p>For each service, the executable file (e.g. "storeds.exe") is used for two purposes: </p><ul>
<li>
Windows invokes the executable to run the service. </li>
<li>
The user manually invokes the executable to <a class="el" href="startupshutdownprocedures.html#configurethewindowsservice">Configure the Windows Service</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>That second purpose, configuring the UM Windows Service, consists of running the executable with one or more command-line options to store desired operational parameters into the Windows registry. This makes those parameters available to the service when Windows starts the service.</p>
<p>First, make sure that your UM license key is provided in a way that the service can access it. In particular, if you are using an environment variable to set the license key, it must be a system environment variable, not user.</p>
<p>Once your license key is ready, there are 4 overall steps to running a UM daemon as a Windows Service: </p><ol>
<li>
<a class="el" href="startupshutdownprocedures.html#installthewindowsservice">Install the Windows Service</a> </li>
<li>
<a class="el" href="startupshutdownprocedures.html#configurethedaemon">Configure the Daemon</a> </li>

<li>
<a class="el" href="startupshutdownprocedures.html#startthewindowsservice">Start the Windows Service</a> </li>
</ol>
<p>All 4 steps must be completed before the Service can be used.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="installthewindowsservice"></a>
Install the Windows Service&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#installthewindowsservice">&lt;-</a></small></h2>
<p>There are two ways to install a UM daemon as a Windows Service: </p><ul>
<li>
Product package installer. </li>
<li>
Command line. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Product package installer</b></p>
<p>When installing the product using the package installer, the dialog box titled "Choose Components" provides one or more check boxes for UM daemons to be installed as services. You may check any number of the boxes and proceed with the installation.</p>
<p>Note that for any box <em>not</em> checked, the software for that daemon is still copied onto the machine. This allows for installation as a Windows Service at a later time using the Command Line method.</p>
<p><b>Command line</b></p>
<p>If a daemon was not installed as a Windows Service from the product's package installer (possibly because the package installer was not used), daemons can be installed at a later time from the command line.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="startli">Open a Windows Command Prompt, enabling Administrator access. (One way to do this is to right-click on the Command Prompt icon and select "More &gt; Run as administrator".)</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
Run the Service executable with the "-s install" command-line option. For example: <div class="fragment"><div class="line">umestoreds -s install</div></div><!-- fragment --> (Note: <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/sford/backup_exclude/labbox/sfordmac_DEV_HF_6_14/29West/lbm/doc/Operations/design.tag:../Design/" href="../Design/manpagesforlbmrd.html#lbmrdsmanpage">lbmrds</a> uses upper-case "-S".) </li>
</ol>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="configurethedaemon"></a>
Configure the Daemon&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#configurethedaemon">&lt;-</a></small></h2>
<p>UM daemons are configured via XML configuration files. These files must be created and managed by the user. Each individual daemon needs its own separate XML configuration file.</p>
<p>Informatica recommends developing and testing the daemon configuration files interactively, using the command-line interface of each daemon. Do not run the daemon as a Windows Service until the daemon configuration has been validated and tested. This provides the fastest test cycle while the configuration is being developed and finalized.</p>
<p>The configuration files should be located on the hosts that are intended to run the daemons in files/folders of the user's choosing.</p>
<p>For more information on configuring and running the daemons interactively, see: </p><table class="doxtable">

<p>"Configure the Windows Service" is different from <a class="el" href="startupshutdownprocedures.html#configurethedaemon">Configure the Daemon</a>. Configuring a UM Service provides Windows-specific operational parameters to the UM Daemon, which are not configurable via the Daemon Configuration. For example, you need to tell the Service where to find the Daemon Configuration file.</p>
<p>At this point, you should have the Daemon XML configuration file(s) prepared and available on the host which is to run the desired daemon(s) (See <a class="el" href="startupshutdownprocedures.html#configurethedaemon">Configure the Daemon</a>). And you should have tested the configuration using the daemon interactively to verify is correct operation.</p>
<p>Configuring the Service consists of running the Service executable from a Windows Command Prompt with one or more command-line options to store desired operational parameters into the Windows registry. This makes those parameters available to the service when Windows starts the service.</p>

<p><b>Daemon Configuration File</b></p>
<p>The UM daemons require a configuration file. You must configure the Windows Service with the path to the daemon's configuration file. This is done with the <code>"-s config"</code> command-line option. For example: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">umestoreds -s config c:\UM\store_config.xml</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> This saves the file path into the Windows registry. Subsequently, each time the UME Store Windows Service starts, it will read that file to configure the Store daemon. (Note: <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/sford/backup_exclude/labbox/sfordmac_DEV_HF_6_14/29West/lbm/doc/Operations/design.tag:../Design/" href="../Design/manpagesforlbmrd.html#lbmrdsmanpage">lbmrds</a> uses upper-case "-S".)</p>
<p><b>Windows Event Logger</b></p>
<p>The UM daemons write their log messages to their log files. The UM Windows Services have the option of also writing the log messages to the Windows Event Logger.</p>
<p>UM Log messages are categorized into different severity levels: "info", "notice", "warning", "err", "alert", "emerg". By default, the UM Windows Services will write log messages of category "warning" and above to the Windows Event Log.</p>
<p>If desired, the category can be configured with the <code>"-e"</code> command-line option. For example: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">umestoreds -e notice</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> This saves the "notice" category into the Windows registry. Subsequently, each time the UME Store Windows Service starts, it will log message of "notice" and above to the Windows Event Log.</p>
<p>Be aware that setting the severity level below "warning" can result in very many messages being written to the Windows Event Log. Also be aware that messages of <em>all</em> severity levels are written to the daemon's log file, independent of the <code>"-e"</code> setting.</p>
<p><b>Environment Variables File</b></p>
<p>The UM daemons occasionally can have useful features enabled through the use of environment variables. Most of the UM Windows Services allow the use of an optional disk file containing environment variable assignments. Each time the Service starts, that file is read and the environment variables are set for that daemon process. The SRS Windows service does not currently support this.</p>
<p>If desired, the Environment Variable file path can be configured with the <code>"-E"</code> command-line option. For example: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">umestoreds -E c:\UM\store_env.txt</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> This saves the file path into the Windows registry. Subsequently, each time the UME Store Windows Service starts, it will read that file and set its environment variables.</p>
<p>The format of that file is shown by this example: </p><pre class="fragment"># Environment Variable File for UME Store
LBM_DEBUG_MASK="0xC384"
LBM_DEBUG_FILENAME="c:\temp\store_debug.txt"
</pre><p> The quote marks are required.</p>
<p>If you want to stop using an environment variable file, you must remove its entry from the Windows registry with the <code>"-U"</code> command-line option. For example: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">umestoreds -U</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> This removes the environment variable file path from the Windows registry. The next time the UME Store Windows Service starts, it will not set its environment. Note that this operation does <em>not</em> remove the environment file.</p>

Start the Windows Service&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#startthewindowsservice">&lt;-</a></small></h2>
<p>Windows Services are controlled by the "Services" control panel. See your Windows documentation for information on controlling Windows Services.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="removethewindowsservice"></a>
Remove the Windows Service&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#removethewindowsservice">&lt;-</a></small></h2>
<p>There are two ways to remove the UM daemons as Windows Services: </p><ul>
<li>
Use the Windows uninstaller. </li>
<li>
Manually remove the service using the daemon's executable program. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Windows Uninstaller</b></p>
<p>If the UM package was installed by the Package Installer, using the normal Windows "Add or Remove Programs" control panel removes the Windows Service, as well as also removing the installed files.</p>
<p><b>Manual Service Removal</b></p>
<p>You can remove a UM Windows Service manually using the <code>"-s remove"</code> command-line option. For example: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">umestoreds -s <span class="keyword">remove</span></div></div><!-- fragment --><p> This removes the UM Store as a Windows Service. (Note: <a class="elRef" doxygen="/29W/Amun/home/sford/backup_exclude/labbox/sfordmac_DEV_HF_6_14/29West/lbm/doc/Operations/design.tag:../Design/" href="../Design/manpagesforlbmrd.html#lbmrdsmanpage">lbmrds</a> uses upper-case "-S".)</p>
<p>Note that this does not uninstall any of the UM software. It only removes the the daemon as a Windows Service.</p>
