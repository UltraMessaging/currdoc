<p class="startli">Build ume-example-rcv-3.c and ume-example-src-3.c. Instructions for building them are at the beginning of the source files.</p>

<p>You should see no output if the Store started successfully. However, you should find a new log file, ume-example-stored.log, in the directory you ran the Store in. The first couple lines should look similar to below.</p>

<p>With the Store running, let's try our example source and receiver applications.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Start the Receiver. <pre class="fragment">$ ume-example-rcv-3.exe
</pre> </li>
<li>
Start the Source. <pre class="fragment">$ ume-example-src-3.exe
</pre> </li>
</ol>
<p>You should see output for the source similar to the following: </p><pre class="fragment">saving RegID info to "UME-example-src-RegID" - 127.0.0.1:14567:2795623327
</pre><p>You should see output for the receiver similar to the following:</p>

...
</pre><p>The example source sends 20 messages. After the 20th messages, both the source and receiver exit and print:<code> &lt;br&gt;</code>removing saved RegID file...` <br />
So what just happened? Let's walk through the output line by line.</p>
<p><b>Source</b></p>
<pre class="fragment">saving RegID info to "UME-example-src-RegID" - 127.0.0.1:14567:2795623327
</pre><p>The source successfully registered with the Store using its pre-configured Store address and port of 127.0.0.1:14567. It didn't ask for a specific RegID from the Store, so the Store automatically assigned one to it. In this case, the Store assigned the ID, 2795623327. Your source's ID will likely be different because Stores assign random RegIDs.</p>
<p>If you run the test again, you'll notice the source application has written a file named '<code>UME-example-src-RegID</code>' that contains the same information the source printed on startup, namely the IP address and port of the Store it registered with, along with its RegID assigned by the Store.</p>
<p><b>Receiver</b></p>
<pre class="fragment">UME Store 0: 127.0.0.1:14567 [TCP:169.254.97.160:14371][2795623327] Requesting RegID: 0
saving RegID info to "UME-example-rcv-RegID" - 127.0.0.1:14567:2795623327:2795623328
</pre><p>The receiver has been informed of how to connect to the Store by the source, and it also successfully registered with the Store. The Store's IP address and port are shown, followed by the source's unique identifier string (in this case, it's a TCP source on port 14371), and the source's RegID. The receiver then requests RegID 0 from the Store, which is a special value that means pick an ID for me (Although not displayed, the source requested ID 0 when it started up as well).</p>
<p>In parallel with the source application, the receiver application writes its RegID with this Store to the file, <code>UME-example-rcv-RegID</code>.</p>
<p>After sending 20 messages under normal, stable conditions, the source and receiver applications exit and remove their RegID files.</p>

<p>Notice that the receiver picked up the message stream right where it had left off - after message 3. The first few messages (which the source had sent while the receiver was down) appear to come in much faster than the source's normal rate of one per second. That's because they are being served to the receiver from the Store. The remaining messages continue to come in at the normal one-per-second rate because they're being received from the source's live message stream. This is durable subscription at work.</p>

</pre><p>When the source was restarted, it read in its previously saved RegID and requested the same ID when registering with the Store. The Store informed the source that it had left off at sequence number 3 (UME Message 04), and the next sequence number it should send is 4 (UME Message 05). Bringing the source back up also caused the receiver to re-register with the Store. Receivers can only find out about Stores from sources they are listening to. Once the receiver re-registered with the Store, it continued receiving messages from the source where it had left off.</p>

Single Store Fails&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><a href="#singlestorefails">&lt;-</a></small></h1>
<p>Perform the following procedure with the Store running to see what happens when the Store itself fails.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="startli">Start the Receiver. </p><pre class="fragment">$ ume-example-rcv-3.exe

<li>
Stop the Store (Ctrl/C). </li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that with this simple example program, the source simply prints the following and exits.</p>
<pre class="fragment">saving RegID info to "UME-example-src-RegID" - 127.0.0.1:14567:4095035673

Store unresponsive: store 0 [127.0.0.1:14567] unresponsive - no registration response.
line 318: not currently registered with enough UMP stores
</pre><p>When a source application tries to send a message without being registered with a Store, the send call returns an error. Messages sent while not registered with a Store cannot be persisted. See <a class="el" href="designingpersistentstores.html">Designing Persistent Stores</a> for information about using multiple Stores.</p>
<p>Your source application(s) should assume an unresponsive Store is a temporary problem and wait before sending the message again. See <code>umesrc.c</code>, <code>umesrc.java</code>, or <code>umesrc.cs</code> for examples of this behavior.</p>
